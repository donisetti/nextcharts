Open source HTML5 charts using the canvas tag. This library is used by NextReports from version 7.

There are some samples (to see how json properties must be specified) in src/html:

main-test.html             independent test
main-jetty-test.html       jetty test (must run ro.nextreports.charts.JsonHandler to start server)
